更大的数据集

也许更多的核数需要更大的种群

小的种群能演化更快

它应该有一个明确的migration rate
随机送还是择优送，复制送还是迁移

对，你可以比较不同的参数的结果

 (1) What is the level of communication necessary to make a parallel GA behave like a panmictic GA? 
(2) What is the cost of this communication? And, 
(3) is the communication cost small enough to make this a viable alternative for the design of parallel GAs? 


 In the ﬁrst, the interval between migrations was set to 5 generations, and the number of processors varied.
 varied the mutation and crossover rates in each deme, attempting to ﬁnd parameter values to balance exploration and exploitation

 there was relatively little change between migrations, but new solutions were found shortly after individuals were exchanged. 
 

试一试不交流然后最后的种群比较一下

没有交流的GA 在某一时刻与单一的GA with rn pop_size performance 表现一样 但是 the average quality of the ﬁnal population was much lower in the parallel isolated GA.

一样的eval time, 单种群的，多种群交流， 多种群不交流

A very important theoretical question is to determine if (and under what conditions) a parallel GA can ﬁnd a better solution than a serial GA

 migration is enabled until the population was close to converge. 

你如何输出不同代数的结果， 要改一下测试代码的结构  recombination

%%% 当前工作重心放在增加更多不一样的数据集以及migration的方式上，

 when is the right time to migrate

 parallel GAs with dense topologiesﬁnd the globalsolution using fewer functionevaluationsthan GAs with sparsely connected ones???


自然的就一定是好的吗？

种群大小

这是一个新的算法， 与并行本身没关系:
 If the subpopulation does not progress for a number of generations, one individual will try local hillclimbing.
